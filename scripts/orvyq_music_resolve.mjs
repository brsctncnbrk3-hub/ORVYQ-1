// Full mode: direction/music_cue_sheet.json's full_cues each declare a real

// resolves to the SAME composition family (task follow-up section 12/16:
// only sb_signal_to_noise / sb_signal_to_noise_nomelody -- see
// composition_family in music_library/registry.json), so the candidate
// reads as one continuous musical world, not nine unrelated compositions.
// Each cue's track is resolved and verified independently against
// music_library/registry.json (hash, license, approved_for_full), extended
// to the exact length it needs (looping through a seamlessly crossfaded
// loop unit if its own source is shorter -- see buildSeamlessLoopUnit), and
// joined to its neighbors with a real overlapping ffmpeg `acrossfade`, with
// the duration each crossfade removes compensated for so the assembled bed
// lands on the exact candidate duration (see buildFullMusicBed) -- into one
// physical assets/music/approved_bed.mp3, the same asset
// scripts/orvyq_audio_mix.mjs has always read, so that script needed no
// structural changes to consume it.
//
// Proof mode still resolves a single track_id from proof_score, kept for
// schema/back-compat -- but as of the proof-is-a-frame-prefix restructuring
// in scripts/orvyq_edit_plan.mjs, no workflow invokes this path anymore:
// proof shares the full candidate's music like everything else it renders.
